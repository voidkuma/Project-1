I attended most of the office hours that were held the week of the due date for this assignment.
I wasn't taught how to make a Make file in my previous classes so I went with the
resources the TA provided for students and youtube videos to see what could fit.

As for solving the functions itself I referred back to GeeksforGeeks for examples for inspiration
to solve the problems, along with the lecture notes that were given to us during class.
